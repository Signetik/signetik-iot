Signetik cell demo Main
########################

Be sure to have copied the most current cell demo library from `coap_client_Lib` before building the main application.

Cmake can be touchy about library paths. Update the path of the `libapp.a` file in the `coap_client_Main/CMakeLists.txt` file to the full path to fix this.
